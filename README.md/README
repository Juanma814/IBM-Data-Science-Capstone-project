# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-project

These files were part of the Final Course to earn the IBM Data Science certification. This final course consist in a Capston project, where we are supposed to collect,
manipulate, and analize data from SpaceX Falcon 9 Rocket's Landings. Some of the tools needed for this project were : Python (Numpy, Pandas, Folium, sqlite, beautifulsoup
seasborn, matplotlib, scikitlearn, among others), SQL, and also theoretical knowledge about Machine learning classification models (Logistic regression, KNN, support 
vector machine, and classification trees).
EDA with SQL was inspired in github user Chuskoo due to issues with IBM Watson Studio
